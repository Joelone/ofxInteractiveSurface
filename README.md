Width this addon you can make interactive ( multiTouch & gestures reactive) surfaces using a KinectSensor.
Note: For best results face the kinect directly to the surface and align the proyecto to it.

## Components

* ofxInteractiveSurface class: esentialy it's a composition of other clases that manage the loading, tracking and rendering. Also it´s the one that send the differents events.

* ofxInteractiveView class: it´s a regular billboard that can be translated, scaled and rotated by a matrix generated by the calibration. Also was a mask made of the contour of the surface.

* ofxKinectAutoCalibrator: auto-mapping tool for surfaces that are strictly facing the kinect. Watch this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=h5dMhWin4i4#!) to see the steps

## How it works
